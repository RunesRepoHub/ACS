# Auto-YT-DL

The code is a Bash script that reads URLs from a text file, downloads videos from those URLs using the mikenye/youtube-dl Docker container, and manages the number of running containers to avoid exceeding a specified limit.

How? The code follows these steps:

* Reads the URLs from a text file located at ~/plex/media/url_file.txt.

* Sets the output path for downloaded videos to ~/plex/media/youtube.

* Defines the maximum number of running containers as 3 and initializes the current number of containers to 0.

* Loops over each URL from the text file:

* Sets the video file path based on the URL.

* Creates the video folder if it doesn't exist.

* Checks the number of running mikenye/youtube-dl Docker containers and waits if the maximum is reached.

* Increments the current number of running containers.

* Downloads the video using the mikenye/youtube-dl Docker container with various options.

* Decrements the current number of running containers.

## Coupling and Cohesion: 

The code appears to have low coupling and high cohesion. The functions and variables are appropriately scoped and organized within the script.

## Single Responsibility Principle: 
The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle to some extent. However, the section responsible for managing the number of running containers could be extracted into a separate function to improve code modularity and readability.
